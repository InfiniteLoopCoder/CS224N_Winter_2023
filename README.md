# CS224N_Winter_2023
This is my personal implementation of all the programming assignments in CS224N Winter 2023. Some formulas in the code need to be derived from the handout file.

For entertainment, I have written an inference program for the Nerual Machine Translation Model implemented in assignment 4, which supports interactive mode and file translation.
